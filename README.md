# Customer Call Center Simulation

A Java-based simulation of a customer call center that handles incoming customer requests using a **priority queue** system. The system is designed to prioritize **VIP** and **urgent** customers for better response time and service quality.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Priority Queue System**  
  Customers are added to the queue based on their priority status: Regular, Urgent, or VIP.

- 🧠 **Object-Oriented Design**  
  Clean and modular code using Object-Oriented Programming principles like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

- 🖥️ **Menu-Driven Interface**  
  Interactive console-based interface to simulate operations such as:
  - Add customer to queue
  - Serve next customer
  - View current queue status
  - Exit simulation

- ⏱️ **Time-Based Escalation Support**  
  Customers waiting too long in the queue are automatically escalated to a higher priority level.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Java
- OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Priority Queue (Java Collections)
